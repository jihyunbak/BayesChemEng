BayesChemEng
============


Matlab code for an effective inference method for analyzing costly experiments, often with multi-dimensional parameters, performed at multiple different settings (sets of design variables) and few repetitions.

## Setup

### Obtaining

You can do one of the following to obtain the latest code package.

* **Download**:   zipped archive  [BayesChemEng-master.zip](https://github.com/jihyunbak/BayesChemEng/archive/master.zip)
* **Clone**: clone the repository from github: ```git clone https://github.com/jihyunbak/BayesChemEng.git```

### Running

* You need MATLAB with the {statistics and machine learning, neural network, curve fitting} toolboxes.
* Code was developed using MATLAB R2016b, although older versions may also work. Please let us know if you have any issue with older releases.



## Example scripts

We provide demo scripts to illustrate how the algorithm works.

### Single dataset

* See `demo1_single.m` for a running example of iterative sampling algorithm, applied to a single dataset.

### Multiple datasets

* (to be added)
